[PROJECT NAME]
    Java trusted Peer (JTP)
    <https://github.com/mr-pathak/jtp>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[SUMMARY]
    * JTP is an open-source peer-to-peer file sharing application. 
    * JTP calculates trust between peers based on their interaction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[DESCRIPTION]
    * In an peer-to-peer information system, peers often have to interact with
      unfamiliar peers and need to manage the risk that is involved 
      with the interactions.
    * JTP is a small step towards development of a trust mechanism for 
      such system so peers can quantify and compare the trustworthiness of other
      peers and perform trusted interactions based on peer ratings.
    * As a project, JTP aim to develop and maintain trust rating for each node
      which is based on its interaction and reviews by other peers.
    * JTP source code is freely available.
    * JTP is under heavy development and  needs plenty of fixes & enhancements.

[TODO]
    JTP is still far from a finished project and aim is to improve enhance it
    features to make it a complete package. JTP is good to get your hand dirty
    but not mature enough to be used at higher level.
    Following are few milestone that will enhance JTP.

    * Implement GUI for JTP
    * Implement different Trust based algorithms
    * Improve current naive trust algorithm
    * Replace Scribe Node by implementing similar Node
    * Add features like chatting, multiple upload
    * Add unit tests for JTP
    * Improve documentation
    * Improve exception handling
    * Improve binary script (no Windows support at the moment)
